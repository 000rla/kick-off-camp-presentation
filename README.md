# Kick-Off-Camp Presentation

We will compare a selection of techniques used to solve differential equations numerically on the example of shallow water waves.

## Dependencies
The solvers require the following dependencies: `alive-progress`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`, `scipy`. These will be installed automatically when installing this package. In addition the `fe_utils` package will also be installed directly from the GitHub repository [here](https://github.com/Imperial-MATH60022/finite-element-2022-NiallOswald).
