# Kick-Off-Camp Presentation

We will compare a selection of techniques used to solve differential equations numerically on the example of shallow water waves.

## Dependencies
The solvers require the following dependencies: `alive-progress`, `matplotlib`, `numpy`. These can be installed using:
```
python -m pip install alive-progress matplotlib numpy
```

In addition the `fe_utils` package will also need to downloaded and installed from [here](https://github.com/Imperial-MATH60022/finite-element-2022-NiallOswald).
